However, the application is not behaving correctly and Chloe has asked John to debug the application. However John complains to you, that he cannot <code>docker exec</code> into the containers to get a bash terminal. <p>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Explain to John why this is the case?</li>
                    	<li>Change the permissions so that John can <code>docker exec</code> into the container. Do this in such a way that only John and Chloe are able to <code>docker exec</code> into the container</li>
